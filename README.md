# maximum-quasi-clique-problem
This repository includes the source code of the proposed OBMA algorithm published in an EJOR paper titled with "An opposition-based memetic algorithm for the maximum quasi-clique problem".

The four sets of 122 benchmark instances are from the classic DIMACS, BHOSLIB, University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection and Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection libraries (refer to [3]). To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here. Due to the too large size of the instances from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, we do not upload them.
